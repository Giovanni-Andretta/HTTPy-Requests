## ðŸ”§ Installation

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

### 2. Activate the virtual environment:

macOS/Linux:
  ```
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

Windows:
  ```
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

Once activated, your terminal prompt will change to show the name of the virtual environment (venv).

### 3. Install Dependencies

After activating the virtual environment, you need to install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install Tkinter

macOS:
  To install Tkinter on macOS, you can use Homebrew:

  ```
  brew install python-tk
  ```

Windows:
  Tkinter is included with Python by default on Windows, so there is no need to install it separately.

### 5. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and Tkinter is set up, you can run the application with:

```
  python3 main.py
```

### 6. Keyboard Shortcuts

- Ctrl + S / Cmd + S â€“ Save the current request
- Ctrl + Z / Cmd + Z â€“ Undo changes
- Ctrl + Shift + Z / Cmd + Shift + Z â€“ Redo changes

### 7. Creating a Visual Shortcut on macOS using Automator (Optional)

If you want to create a visual shortcut to run the application on your Mac, you can do so using **Automator**:

Steps to Create an Automator Shortcut:

1. Open **Automator** (you can search for it using Spotlight).
2. Choose **Application** when prompted to select a document type.
3. In the search bar on the left, type **Run Shell Script** and double-click it to add it to your workflow.
4. In the **Run Shell Script** box, paste the following command:

    ```
    cd /path/to/your/project
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python3 main.py
    ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory.

5. Save the Automator application with a name like `HTTPy Request.app` to your **Desktop**.
6. Once saved, you can now double-click this application anytime to launch your HTTP Request Sender and Manager app.
7. Optionally, you can drag this new Automator application to your **Dock** for easy access.

Now, you have a convenient visual shortcut to run your app directly from your desktop or Dock!
