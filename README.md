## üí° About the Project

Application to send and manage HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using Python, Tkinter, and cURL (executed via subprocess). It allows you to easily create, save, and load HTTP requests, view responses, and manage request history.

## Functionalities

- **Send HTTP Requests:** You can send HTTP requests using different methods like GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
- **View Responses:** The application displays the status code and content of the response from the server. The response is also **formatted** for easier reading.
- **Save and Load Requests:** Requests can be saved with custom names and loaded for future use.
- **Automatic Load of Last Saved Request:** When the application starts, it automatically loads the last saved request, allowing you to continue where you left off.
- **List Requests:** View a list of all saved requests. You can select a request from the list and load it back into the request fields.
- **Duplicate or Delete Saved Requests:** You can duplicate saved requests from the list.
- **Remove Request:** You can remove any saved request, deleting it permanently.
- **Undo/Redo History:** You can undo or redo any changes made to the request fields (such as URL, headers, body).
- **Animation on Send Button:** When you click the **Send** button, a small **dot blinks twice** and changes color to match the HTTP status code of the response (e.g., green for success, red for errors).
- **Body Field Indentation:** The body field is designed to make indentation easier, providing a better user experience when working with JSON or other structured data.

### üîç **How It Works**

The application constructs and executes `curl` commands based on the user input, including URL, HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), headers, body, and query parameters. The constructed command is executed via Python's `subprocess` module, and the response is displayed in the app.

**Example of the generated cURL command:**

If the user fills out the following fields:

- **URL**: `http://0.0.0.0:3000/dev/tests`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Body**: (empty)
- **Params**: "organization_code=test"
- **Authorization**: "Bearer 123"
- **Headers**: "application/json""

The app generates the following cURL command:

```bash
curl -s -X GET "http://0.0.0.0:3000/dev/tests?organization_code=test" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer 123" \
-w %{http_code}
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- Ctrl + z / Command + z ‚Äì Undo changes

## üîß Installation

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment, open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

### 2. Activate the virtual environment:

macOS/Linux:
  ```
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

Windows:
  ```
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

Once activated, your terminal prompt will change to show the name of the virtual environment (venv).

### 3. Install Tkinter

macOS:
  To install Tkinter on macOS, you can use Homebrew:

  ```
  brew install python-tk
  ```

Windows:
  Tkinter is included with Python by default on Windows, so there is no need to install it separately.

### 4. Ensure cURL is installed

macOS/Linux: cURL is usually pre-installed.

Windows: If you get an error that cURL is not recognized, download and install cURL or ensure it‚Äôs added to your system PATH.

### 5. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed and Tkinter is set up, you can run the application with:

```
  python3 main.py
```

### 6. Creating a Visual Shortcut on macOS using Automator (Optional)

If you want to create a visual shortcut to run the application on your Mac, you can do so using **Automator**:

Steps to Create an Automator Shortcut:

1. Open **Automator** (you can search for it using Spotlight).
2. Choose **Application** when prompted to select a document type.
3. In the search bar on the left, type **Run Shell Script** and double-click it to add it to your workflow.
4. In the **Run Shell Script** box, paste the following command:

    ```
    cd /path/to/your/project
    source .venv/bin/activate
    python3 main.py
    ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory.

5. Save the Automator application with a name like `HTTPy Request.app` to your **Desktop**.
6. Once saved, you can now double-click this application anytime to launch your HTTP Request Sender and Manager app.
7. Optionally, you can drag this new Automator application to your **Dock** for easy access.

Now, you have a convenient visual shortcut to run your app directly from your desktop or Dock!
